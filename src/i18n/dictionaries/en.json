      "part1": "Born in Santiago, Chile in 1998, I grew up in an environment where art and culture were omnipresent. From an early age, I was drawn to writing and theater, two forms of expression that allowed me to explore the world and bring my ideas to life.",
      "part2": "After studying performing arts at the University of Chile, I joined a theater company where I was able to develop my skills as an actress and writer. This experience allowed me to understand the importance of artistic collaboration and the constant search for new forms of expression.",
      "part3": "In 2022, I decided to continue my journey in Paris, where I completed a master's degree in creative writing. This experience opened up new perspectives for me and allowed me to develop a more personal approach to my art, at the crossroads of several disciplines and cultures."
